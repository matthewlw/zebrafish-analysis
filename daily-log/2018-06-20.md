- Put together a short RISE presentation in case we needed anything for the lunch meeting
- Track the orientations of the eyes over time:
  - Extract them from the region properties
  - Plot them on a graph
  - Quantify the errors by plotting the angle differences over time
- Changed the "tiny blob" cutoff in the medial axis code to use 20 pixels instead of 4; this massively cut down on noise.
- Converted the medial axis code to use thin instead of, you know, medial_axis. It worked pretty well!

Conversation with Dr. Pujala:
- Try to port the circle detection algorithm to Python (using polar)
