- Try to see whether I can detect the arcs in the initial image
- Try to determine the pixel dimensions of the dish
- Try to see whether I can determine easily whether an image was taken near the
  edge, so that I can apply different processing there
- Return to the medial axis work from yesterday, to see if I can reconstruct
  the fish from the model parameters
- Read through the scikit-image documentation to cut down on future accidental
  re-implementations
- Gain access to the lab analysis server and install software
- Begin looking through Avinash's MATLAB code, identifying critical functions
- Begin translating `FindFishPxlsForMidlineTracking` into Python
