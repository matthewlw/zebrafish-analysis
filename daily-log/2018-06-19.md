- Began examining blob detection in scikit-image
- Incorporated Dr. Pujala's cropping code into my processing sequence
- Determined the best way to binarize the cropped images
- Wrote a couple routines for embedding videos and video pairs in Jupyter notebooks
- I tried using the medial axis detection in scikit-learn. It didn't work particularly well; it had a bunch of fibers jutting out.
